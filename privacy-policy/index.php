                <h2>What data does CloudCat store?</h2>
                <p>
                    CloudCat stores the data related to any files you upload to it
                    on the server's file system. The file itself cannot be linked
                    back to the user who uploaded it, and is given a file name
                    which, again, cannot be linked back to the original file name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CloudCat application makes these links through an internal
                    database, which keeps a record of the files which a user owns,
                    and which files these correspond to on the server file system.
